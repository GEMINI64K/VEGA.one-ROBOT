Hi
We are embarking on an exciting project aimed at helping you learn some interesting 
concepts such as , 3D modeling within a CAD software like (FUSSION360), Electronics and sensors, Node.js and Matlab.

The primary goal of this project is to create a dynamic, versatile, visually appealing and user-friendly robot that incorporates cutting-edge tech at fraction of the cost.

This project is brocken down into 2 groups. the 3D models for the frame and the software that is used to run all the components of the robot.
